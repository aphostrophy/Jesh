# Introduction

This is a small project of mine that I started because I want to practice programming in C and also to learn the inner workings of shell and the UNIX system calls. This is a very-very basic shell at the moment with a lot of limitations. will try to extend the capabilities and features of this shell as time goes by. At the moment this is just a mock application.

# How to run

make shell  
make run

Enjoy!
